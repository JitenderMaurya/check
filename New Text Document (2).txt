Dear Yamaguchi-San,

I want to conform my understanding on Additional request.
In sample selection procedure step 2. when i have to visualize the score maps. i have visualize score map particularly for pot hole detection on Indian dataset. Select Indian samples where the score map fails to appropriately detect pot hole damages. Then based on image similarity i have to select similar (Indian images from train set) & gradually introduce pothole pixel annotation of these selected sample observe the changes in improvement on accuracy on Indian dataset 
Dear Yamaguchi-San,

I would like to confirm my understanding regarding the additional request related to the sample selection procedure, specifically Step 2.

As I understand, during the visualization of score maps‚Äîparticularly for pothole detection on the Indian dataset‚ÄîI should identify Indian samples where the score map fails to accurately detect pothole damage. Based on this, I should then select visually similar Indian images from the training set using image similarity techniques. Gradually, I will introduce pixel-level pothole annotations for these selected samples and observe the resulting improvements in detection accuracy on the Indian dataset.

Please let me know if this understanding is correct or if any clarification is neede
